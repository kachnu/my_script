# xorg.conf (X.Org X Window System server configuration file)
#
# This is a replacement xorg.conf file designed to work around various
# automated xorg.conf errors sgfxi users have been seeing, from things like
# aticonfig, nvidia-config as well as possibly distro config tools.
#
# Please check your original xorg.conf found here: /etc/X11/xorg-conf-orig-sg
# to make sure your keyboard and mouse data are correct.
#
# Download URL: http://smxi.org/sg/data/dm-1-xorg-conf
#
# Edit this file with caution, and see the xorg.conf manual page.
# (Type "man xorg.conf" at the shell prompt.)
#
# This file is automatically updated on xserver-xorg package upgrades *only*
# if it has not been modified since the last upgrade of the xserver-xorg
# package.
#
# If you have edited this file but would like it to be automatically updated
# again, run the following command:
#   dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
